The problem statement of this project  is to predict the future stock prices of a given company using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs are a type of probabilistic model that can be used to model time series data, such as stock prices. The goal is to train an HMM model on historical stock price data, and then use this model to predict future stock prices. The code uses the yfinance library to download the historical stock price data, the hmmlearn library to train the HMM model, and the matplotlib library to visualize the actual and predicted stock prices. The specific problem being addressed is not defined in the code, but could be any problem related to stock price prediction for a given company.
